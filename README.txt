My code was writen using Pyramid. For execute it, do you have install the Pyramid in your computer
(http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/narr/install.html#installing-chapter).
After, copy the files to where you installed the Pyramid and execute the development.ini file using the shell of your OS
(http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/narr/project.html).
So, acess the page using the link http://localhost:6543/.
There you can upload file with the routes for the problem. Each route should looks like this: 3,1:1,2:3,4:2.
where the fiRst position that is the number 3, is the amount of itens of route.
The other positions are the gas stations 'g:c', where 'g' is the amount of gas in the station
and c is the amount of gas to get the station. Click in the submit button and see the result.
